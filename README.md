# How to deploy a simple Plotly Dash app on Heroku

* A full explanation is available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/how-to-deploy-a-simple-plotly-dash-app-to-heroku-622a2216eb73).
* You can view the finished app on [Heroku](https://flying-dog.herokuapp.com/).
* If you'd like to tinker with the colors of your app, try using HEX codes from [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)!  
* The `assets` folder contains a file called `favicon.ico` -- you can find and download customized favicons [here](https://www.favicon.cc/). Just replace the current favicon with a new one.
* Plotly Dash apps can only be viewed in a modern browser (like Chrome or Mozilla). They won't render in antediluvian browsers such as Microsoft.
